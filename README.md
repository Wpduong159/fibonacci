# Fibonacci
## Using Exhaustive Pattern and Golden Ratio Approach

## Part A)
The code will recursively produce the Fibonacci Sequence and output the 15th term in the sequence

## Part B)
The code will use the Golden Ratio approach to output the first 20 terms of the sequence and check if it is correspondent to the Golden Ratio

d) As seen when using f3 and f30, the ratio between those two terms is extremely far aprt from the golden ratio. If one used two consecutive terms (fn and fn-1) then as n increases the ratio between those terms approaches the golden ratio.
